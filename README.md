so, quick rundown: 
- source is spagetti code. stuff was added as was found out. deal with it.
- visual studio 2017 was used to compile
- source needs boost and mysqlclient libraries, you need to set these up in the project to be able to compile it
- a compiled exe is in the zip ready to be used
- database requires MariaDB (most current MySQL did NOT work)
- see config.ini for configuring configs
- server also requires the itemlist from the client, see zip above
- source can be compiled for both windows and linux
- you can register an account by calling the "register" stored function

```
select register("username", "password", "charname", "email");
```
